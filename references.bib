abstract = {Hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe, and its 21cm line is a very important observational probe for radio astronomy. The 21cm cosmology is a forefront of current research. I first briefly introduce the physics of the 21 line emission and absorption, and its observational signature during the cosmic evolution. Then I describe some ongoing 21cm tomography experimental efforts, and illustrate the typical experimental setup with the Tianlai pathfinder array; the global spectrum experiment is also briefly introduced. The basics of synthesis imaging are briefly introduced, and the challenge posed by foreground presented, with an example of foreground subtraction using the PCA method. The foreground wedge in the 21cm power spectrum is explained. Finally, I conclude with an outlook to future development.}

abstract = {The epoch of reionization (EoR) sets a fundamental benchmark in cosmic structure formation, corresponding to the formation of the first luminous objects that act to ionize the neutral intergalactic medium (IGM). Recent observations at near-IR and radio wavelengths imply that we are finally probing into this key epoch of galaxy formation at z⩾6. The Square Kilometer Array (SKA) will provide critical insight into the EoR, in a number of ways. First, the ability of the SKA to image the neutral IGM in 21-cm emission is a truly unique probe of the process of reionization, and is recognized as the next necessary and fundamental step in our study of the evolution of large scale structure and cosmic reionization. Second, study of HI 21-cm absorption toward the first radio loud objects probes small to intermediate scale structure in the neutral ‘cosmic web’, as well as HI in the first collapsed structures (proto-disks and mini-halos). And third, the incomparable sensitivity of the SKA allows for the study of the molecular gas, dust, and star formation activity in the first galaxies, as well as the radio continuum emission from the first accreting massive black holes. Such objects will be obscured at optical wavelengths due to absorption by the neutral IGM.}
