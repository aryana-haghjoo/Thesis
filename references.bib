abstract = {Hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe, and its 21cm line is a very important observational probe for radio astronomy. The 21cm cosmology is a forefront of current research. I first briefly introduce the physics of the 21 line emission and absorption, and its observational signature during the cosmic evolution. Then I describe some ongoing 21cm tomography experimental efforts, and illustrate the typical experimental setup with the Tianlai pathfinder array; the global spectrum experiment is also briefly introduced. The basics of synthesis imaging are briefly introduced, and the challenge posed by foreground presented, with an example of foreground subtraction using the PCA method. The foreground wedge in the 21cm power spectrum is explained. Finally, I conclude with an outlook to future development.}
